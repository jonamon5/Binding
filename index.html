			<h1>Advertising the Magic System</h1>
			<p>
				Raymond Williams's essay was originally written as a chapter in his 1961 book The Long
				Revolution, but was published only later and as an essay. It
				belongs to an older form of British-orientated cultural studies
				than the other essays collected here, but one that it is important
				not to forget. It stands apart in two main ways: first, for
				Williams, cultural studies moves unproblematically back into
				cultural history. For him, telling the story of advertising’s
				development allows one to grasp the forces which condition it now,
				and also, thus, to begin to be able to conceive of a different
				contemporary function for advertising. Second, Williams writes as
				a committed socialist; for him private sector capitalism cannot
				fulfill the needs of society as a whole. Today it is, perhaps,
				harder to promote state socialism than to insist that cultural
				studies requires historical narratives. But it is not as though
				these two strands of Williams’s essay are quite separate. For him,
				the history of advertising shows a minor mode of communication
				becoming a major one – a vital component in the organization and
				reproduction of capital. In a metaphor which goes back to Marx’s
				belief that capitalism makes commodities <q>fetishes</q>, for
				Williams advertising is <q>magic</q> because it transforms
				commodities into glamorous signifiers (turning a car into a sign
				of masculinity, for instance) and these signifiers present an
				imaginary, in the sense of unreal, world. Most of all, capitalism
				makes us forget how much work and suffering went into the
				production of commodities. Williams’s history aims to dis-enchant
				capitalism: to show us what it really is. It might be objected, of
				course, that advertising’s magic (like many magics) actually
				works: that, today, the use-value of many commodities is their
				signifying-function. But that objection (and others) which may
				occur to readers does not spoil the essay’s power to defamiliarize
				the current advertising industry through erudite narrative
				history.
