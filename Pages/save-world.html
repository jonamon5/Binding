            It’s not till you’re older that you realize kids are repositories
            for half-truths. They’re told the most extraordinary things. You
            could be president some day. You could compete in the Olympics.
            Grown-ups dispense these fantasies with earnest hope, knowing that
            the chances of their child fulfilling such a goal are very slim.

            "<span class="save-world">Designers can save the world</span>," was
            a common phrase I heard upon entering design school. It was the
            ultimate half-truth, one that resulted in class critiques filled
            with eco-inspired projects: billboards lined with solar panels, cell
            phones made of birdseed, wind-powered villages. Though the sentiment
            was admirable, these solutions were designed by students with no
            understanding of real-world economics and politics. Little did we
            know that to attach even one solar panel onto a billboard can take
            years of lobbying. That’s the problem with designing for a better
            planet—most solutions require too much time and result in adding
            more physical stuff to an already bursting planet.

            Ralph Caplan advises us not to underestimate the power of situation
            design, or “the concept of moving from the design of things to the
            design of the circumstance in which things are used.” He asserts,
            “The most elegant design solution of the fifties was not the molded
            plywood chair or the Olivetti Lettera 22 or the chapel at Ronchamp.
            It was the sit-in.” Finally, a definition of design that emphasizes
            the economy of time, an understanding of resource availability, and
            most importantly, using what’s at hand rather than producing more
            goods to solve a problem.

            Had I been armed with Caplan’s definition of situation design, what
            would I have done differently?

            If given the chance at a do-over, how would I save the world as a
            design student? The answer came to me over a carton of orange juice
            at my neighborhood bodega. In the few seconds it took to dig through
            my change purse, the cashier had already placed the orange juice in
            a plastic bag, thrusting it toward me over the counter. As a
            small-town southerner who had not yet grown past her mild manners, I
            sheepishly took the plastic sack, despite the empty canvas tote
            hanging from my shoulder. Now that I’ve grown accustomed to
            fast-paced urban transactions, I approach the register and blurt
            out, “No bag please,” with all the practiced anxiety of a Woody
            Allen film. My shopping neurosis led me to contemplate the thousands
            of transactions that take place across the world.
