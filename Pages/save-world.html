          It’s not till you’re older that you realize kids are repositories
          for half-truths. They’re told the most extraordinary things. You
          could be president some day. You could compete in the Olympics.
          Grown-ups dispense these fantasies with earnest hope, knowing that
          the chances of their child fulfilling such a goal are very slim.

          <q><span class="save-world">Designers can save the world</span>,</q> was
          a common phrase I heard upon entering design school. It was the
          ultimate half-truth, one that resulted in class critiques filled
          with eco-inspired projects: billboards lined with solar panels, cell
          phones made of birdseed, wind-powered villages. Though the sentiment
          was admirable, these solutions were designed by students with no
          understanding of real-world economics and politics. Little did we
          know that to attach even one solar panel onto a billboard can take
          years of lobbying. That’s the problem with designing for a better
          planet—most solutions require too much time and result in adding
          more physical stuff to an already bursting planet.

          Ralph Caplan advises us not to underestimate the power of situation
          design, or “the concept of moving from the design of things to the
          design of the circumstance in which things are used.” He asserts,
          “The most elegant design solution of the fifties was not the molded
          plywood chair or the Olivetti Lettera 22 or the chapel at Ronchamp.
          It was the sit-in.” Finally, a definition of design that emphasizes
          the economy of time, an understanding of resource availability, and
          most importantly, using what’s at hand rather than producing more
          goods to solve a problem.

          If given the chance at a do-over, how would I save the world as a
          design student? The answer came to me over a carton of orange juice
          at my neighborhood bodega. In the few seconds it took to dig through
          my change purse, the cashier had already placed the orange juice in
          a plastic bag, thrusting it toward me over the counter. As a
          small-town southerner who had not yet grown past her mild manners, I
          sheepishly took the plastic sack, despite the empty canvas tote
          hanging from my shoulder. Now that I’ve grown accustomed to
          fast-paced urban transactions, I approach the register and blurt
          out, “No bag please,” with all the practiced anxiety of a Woody
          Allen film. My shopping neurosis led me to contemplate the thousands
          of transactions that take place across the world.

          That’s when I realized how design could really save the world. Rather than design and market another cute,
          reusable tote, I would create a campaign to redesign the shopping transaction, a project in which the only
          product is a question asked by the cashier: “Would you like a bag?” Though this seems like the most minuscule
          of project goals, giving buyers an option is the first step toward breaking a habit.

          While we wait for cities, states, and countries to enact plastic bag bans that may take years, one thing is

          It's not like companies aren't trying—they occasionally print encouraging phrases on the bottom of each bag.
          "Be good to the environment," many plastic bags implore. "Reuse this bag as a garbage can liner." But in the
          past decade, as plastic bags have come under fire, it seems the only change at the cash register has been an
          additional rack containing 99-cent reusable tote bags. While we wait for cities, states, and countries to
          enact plastic bag bans that may take years, one thing is certain: a behavioral change is needed.

          Earlier this year when reviewing the results of the Design for Change School Contest, an initiative that
          encourages children in India to target and address an environmental problem in their community, the vast
          majority of the entries pinpointed plastic bag pollution. Children photographed hundreds of plastic bags
          clogging drainage systems and waterways. Fortunately, the kids did something about it — they gathered recycled
          materials and stitched together reusable bags that were subsequently distributed to shoppers in surrounding
          towns.

          So in a case such as this, can designers save the world, or will it continue to be a half-truth? I’m not sure.
          But the sooner we realize that the simple (and local) answer is sometimes the right answer, we’ll be closer to
          understanding the true capabilities of designers. Erecting wind turbines in the desert would be nice, but
          designing a system that encourages kids in the neighborhood to stop littering can result in immediate,
          meaningful change. Further, if we could mobilize our design schools to act as sentinels that deploy situation
          design to address problems within local communities, imagine what we could accomplish. It would go far beyond
          plastic bags.
        </p>
        <p>
          For designers, it is important to look at the problems and resources at hand without getting lost in fantasies
          of global healing powers. It is this sort of humility that Caplan emphasizes: “...I have claimed that design
          solves problems. It often does. But when we call designers problem solvers, the connotations are very grand…It
          helps to remember that, to a person hungry for scrambled eggs, a short-order cook is a problem solver.”
