				<p>Elisha Otis did create the safety catch that would prevent a vertically mobile enclosure from plummeting from great heights to great depths at very high speeds, injuring its passengers. This invention was demonstrated at the 1853 World's Fair in New York, almost five thousand years after the elevator first came into usage.</p>
				<p>
					Technically, Otis did not invent the elevator, although he is regularly credited with it. But it was his incremental improvement to an existing technology that launched what we now know as the elevator industry, the great facilitator of skyscraping cities, of vertical living, working, and buying.
				</p>
				<p>
					Otis exemplifies what I call the designer's dilemma - the tension that exists in the space between inventing and improving. If the designer's role is to drive innovation on a large scale, how can we resolve ourselves to the incremental improvements that are necessitated by today's increasingly complex culture?
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, this question is more relevant than ever: there is no single innovation that can counteract the innumerable injuries we have done to the global ecosystem. But if the key to tackling our environmental challenges lies within this world of iterative change and cumulative improvement - and I believe that it does - then what does this mean for design as a whole?
