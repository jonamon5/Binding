						<p>
							RAYMOND WILLIAMS’S ESSAY was originally written as a chapter in his 1961 book The Long
							Revolution,
							but was published only later and as an essay. It belongs to an older form of
							British-orientated
							cultural studies than the other essays collected here, but one that it is important not to
							forget.
						</p>
						<p>
							It stands apart in two main ways: first, for Williams, cultural studies moves
							unproblematically back
							into cultural history. For him, telling the story of advertising’s development allows one to
							grasp
							the forces which condition it now, and also, thus, to begin to be able to conceive of a
							different
							contemporary function for advertising. Second, Williams writes as a committed socialist; for
							him
							privatesector capitalism cannot fulfill the needs of society as a whole.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today it is, perhaps, harder to promote state socialism than to insist that cultural studies
							requires historical narratives. But it is not as though these two strands of Williams’s
							essay are
							quite separate. For him, the history of advertising shows a minor mode of communication
							becoming a
							major one – a vital component in the organization and reproduction of capital. In a metaphor
							which
							goes back to Marx’s belief that capitalism makes commodities “fetishes,” for Williams
							advertising is
							“magic” because it transforms commodities into glamorous signifiers (turning a car into a
							sign of
							masculinity, for instance) and these signifiers present an imaginary, in the sense of
							unreal, world.
							Most of all, capitalism makes us forget how much work and suffering went into the production
							of
							commodities. Williams’s history aims to dis-enchant capitalism: to show us what it really
							is. It
							might be objected, of course, that advertising’s magic (like many magics) actually works:
							that,
							today, the use-value of many commodities is their signifying-function. But that objection
							(and
							others) which may occur to readers does not spoil the essay’s power to defamiliarize the
							current
							advertising industry through erudite narrative history.

				<h2>History</h2>
				<div class="grid-container-left">
					<article class="left-article">
						<p>
							It is customary to begin even the shortest account of the history of advertising by
							recalling the
							three-thousand-year-old papyrus from Thebes, offering a reward for a runaway slave, and to
							go on to
							such recollections as the crier in the streets of Athens, the paintings of gladiators, with
							sentences urging attendance at their combats, in ruined Pompeii, and the fly-bills on the
							pillars of
							the Forum in Rome. This pleasant little ritual can be quickly performed, and as quickly
							forgotten:
							it is, of course, altogether too modest. If by advertising we mean what was meant by
							Shakespeare and
							the translators of the Authorized Version – the processes of taking or giving notice of
							something –
							it is as old as human society, and some pleasant recollections from the Stone Age could be
							quite
							easily devised.
						</p>
						<p>
							The real business of the historian of advertising is more difficult: to trace the
							development from
							processes of specific attention and information to an institutionalized system of commercial
							information and persuasion; to relate this to changes in society and in the economy: and to
							trace
							changes in method in the context of changing organizations and intentions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The spreading of information, by the crier or by handwritten and printed broadsheets, is
							known from
							all periods of English society. The first signs of anything more organized come in the
							seventeenth
							century, with the development of newsbooks, mercuries and newspapers. Already certain
							places, such
							as St Paul’s in London, were recognized as centres for the posting of specific bills, and
							the
							extension of such posting to the new printed publications was a natural development. The
							material of
							such advertisements ranged from offers and wants in personal service, notices of the
							publication of
							books, and details of runaway servants, apprentices, horses and dogs, to announcements of
							new
							commodities available at particular shops, enthusiastic announcements of remedies and
							specifics, and
							notices of the public showing of monsters, prodigies and freaks. While the majority were the
							simple,
							basically factual and specific notices we now call ‘classified’, there were also direct
							recommendations, as here, from 1658:

						<p>
							Mention of the physicians begins that process of extension from the conventional
							recommendations of
							books as ‘excellent’ or ‘admirable’ and the conventional branding, packaging and a good
							‘selling
							line’. I remember being told by a man I knew at university (he had previously explained how
							useful,
							to his profession as an advertiser, had been his training in the practical criticism of
							advertisements) that advertisements you booked and paid for were really old stuff; the real
							thing
							was what got through as ordinary news. This seems to happen now with goods: ‘product
							centenaries’,
							for example. But with persons it is even more extensive. It began in entertainment,
							particularly
							with film actors, and it is still in this field that it does most of its work. It is very
							difficult
							to pin down, because the borderline between the item or photograph picked up in the ordinary
							course
							of journalism and broadcasting, and the similar item or photograph that has been arranged
							and paid
							for, either directly or through special hospitality by a publicity agent, is obviously
							difficult to
							draw. Enough stories get through, and are even boasted about, to indicate that the paid
							practice is
							extensive, though payment, except to the agent, is usually in hospitality (if that word can
							be used)
							or in kind. Certainly, readers of newspapers should be aware that the ‘personality’ items,
							presented
							as ordinary news stories or gossip, will often have been paid for, in one way or another, in
							a
							system that makes straightforward advertising, by comparison, look respectable. Nor is this
							confined
							to what is called ‘show business’; it has certainly entered literature, and it hasprobably
							entered
							politics.
						</p>
						<p>
							The extension is natural, in a society where selling, by any effective means, has become a
							primary
							ethic. The spectacular growth of advertising, and then its extension to apparently
							independent
							reporting, has behind it not a mere pressure group, as in the days of the quacks, but the
							whole
							impetus of a society. It can then be agreed that we have come a long way from the papyrus of
							the
							runaway slave and the shouts of the town-crier: that what we have to look at is an organized
							and
							extending system, at the centre of our national life.

				<h2>The System</h2>
				<div class="grid-container-left">
					<article class="left-article">
						<p> In the last hundred years, then, advertising has developed from the simple announcements of
							shopkeepers and the persuasive arts of a few marginal dealers into a major part of
							capitalist
							business organization. This is important enough, but the place of advertising in society
							goes far
							beyond this commercial context. It is increasingly the source of finance for a whole range
							of
							general communication, to the extent that in 1960 our majority television service and almost
							all our
							newspapers and periodicals could not exist without it. Further, in the last forty years and
							now at
							an increasing rate, it has passed the frontier of the selling of goods and services and has
							become
							involved with the teaching of social and personal values; it is also rapidly entering the
							world of
							politics. Advertising is also, in a sense, the official art of modern capitalist society: it
							is what
							‘we’ put up in ‘our’ streets and use to fill up to half of ‘our’ newspapers and magazines:
							and it
							commands the services of perhaps the largest organized body of writers and artists, with
							their
							attendant managers and advisers, in the whole society. Since this is the actual social
							status of
							advertising, we shall understand it with any adequacy only if we can develop a kind of total
							analysis in which the economic, social and cultural facts are visibly related. We may then
							also
							find, taking advertising as a major form of modern social communication, that we can
							understand our
							society itself in new ways.
						</p>
						<p> It is often said that our society is too materialist, and that advertising reflects this. We
							are in
							the phase of a relatively rapid distribution of what are called ‘consumer goods’, and
							advertising,
							with its emphasis on ‘bringing the good things of life’, is taken as central for this
							reason. But it
							seems to me that in this respect our society is quite evidently not materialist enough, and
							that
							this, paradoxically, is the result of a failure in social meanings, values and ideals.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is impossible to look at modern advertising without realizing that the material object
							being sold
							is never enough: this indeed is the crucial cultural quality of its modern forms. If we were
							sensibly materialist, in that part of our living in which we use things, we should find most
							advertising to be of an insane irrelevance. Beer would be enough for us, without the
							additional
							promise that in drinking it we show ourselves to be manly, young in heart or neighbourly. A
							washing
							machine would be a useful machine to wash clothes, rather than an indication that we are
							forwardlooking or an object of envy to our neighbours. But if these associations sell beer
							and
							washing machines, as some of the evidence suggests, it is clear that we have a cultural
							pattern in
							which the objects are not enough but must be validated, if only in fantasy, by association
							with
							social and personal meanings which in a different cultural pattern might be more directly
							available.
							The short description of the pattern we have is magic: a highly organized and professional
							system of
							magical inducements and satisfactions, functionally very similar to magical systems in
							simpler
							societies, but rather strangely coexistent with a highly developed scientific technology.

						<p>
							This contradiction is of the greatest importance in any analysis of modem capitalist
							society. The
							coming of large-scale industrial production necessarily raised critical problems of social
							organization, which in many fields we are still only struggling to solve. In the production
							of goods
							for personal use, the critical problem posed by the factory of advanced machines was that of
							the
							organization of the market. The modern factory requires not only smooth and steady
							distributive
							channels (without which it would suffocate under its own product) but also definite
							indications of
							demand without which the expensive processes of capitalization and equipment would be too
							great a
							risk. The historical choice posed by the development of industrial production is between
							different
							forms of organization and planning in the society to which it is central. In our own
							century, the
							choice has been and remains between some form of socialism and a new form of capitalism. In
							Britain,
							since the 1890s and with rapidly continuing emphasis, we have had the new capitalism, based
							on a
							series of devices for organizing and ensuring the market. Modern advertising, taking on its
							distinctive features in just this economic phase, is one of the most important of these
							devices, and
							it is perfectly true to say that modern capitalism could not function without it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yet the essence of capitalism is that the basic means of production are not socially but
							privately
							owned, and that decisions about production are therefore in the hands of a group occupying a
							minority position in the society and in no direct way responsible to it. Obviously, since
							the
							capitalist wishes to be successful, he is influenced in his decisions about production by
							what other
							members of the society need. But he is influenced also by considerations of industrial
							convenience
							and likely profit, and his decisions tend to be a balance of these varying factors. The
							challenge of
							socialism, still very powerful elsewhere but in Britain deeply confused by political
							immaturities
							and errors, is essentially that decisions about production should be in the hands of the
							society as
							a whole, in the sense that control of the means of production is made part of the general
							system of
							decision which the society as a whole creates. The conflict between capitalism and socialism
							is now
							commonly seen in terms of a competition in productive efficiency, and we need not doubt that
							much of
							our future history, on a world scale, will be determined by the results of this competition.
							Yet the
							conflict is really much deeper than this, and is also a conflict between different
							approaches to and
							forms of socialism. The fundamental choice that emerges, in the problems set to us by modern
							industrial production, is between man as consumer and man as user. The system of organized
							magic
							which is modern advertising is primarily important as a functional obscuring of this choice.
